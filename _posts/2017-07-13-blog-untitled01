Hey,

Can't believe it's July now, it's been [so fast](https://open.spotify.com/track/7CoEiPt9TLNTXEjJnu0KVO)...

Too many thoughts, but I can only write this much. It's like a bottleneck of thoughts. Just well...

It has only been 1 month, but it's been fun. Really. 

Sweets and sours. Ups and downs. But you're more than those. 

You're my [favourite thing](https://open.spotify.com/track/7hyY0IM6B3Ey4dBgEIhb23). 

You're my happiness.

But you may be leaving. 

You know I'm not good in expressing myself. But anyhow, I just want to say that: 

If you're leaving,

do tell me all about the travel, let me know if you've safely arrived. 

Tell me about every transit like how we always do. 

If you're leaving,

do tell me all about your new life - the places, the people, the food, new things you tried, the travels, the scenery... 

And I wouldn't ask for too much details, because your voice and expressions of excitement would be enough to tell me all about it. 

If you're leaving,
