This is important. It's been some time since I last actually enjoy shooting an event and here is it. One that I actually enjoy. It's important because I've finally found the 'feelings' I had been looking for. And so yeah I'd been very artsy for this one.

When the wheat rippled in the breeze, and when the rivers winded to the sea, you overheard the birds chirping in your dreams; the harmony between all of mankind and nature is felt.

Now that the storm is over, so shall the rainbow precedes; for which the folks say: no cross, no crown!

A warm, sunny breeze lingers through their faces, whispering: you did it, you did it! All of your sweat and tears, their determination and hardships, are hence traded with a heartwarming success.
