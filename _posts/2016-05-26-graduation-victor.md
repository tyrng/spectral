As someone whom is still in his earliest of twenties, I can't deny that life is full of uncertainties.

Having watched the graduates in their gowns and mortarboards walking out to the tip of the open - the wild, wild society, I could almost feel their anxiety for what is to come to them.

But it was also that time, I could see hope - for brighter days, and passion - of doing what they do best and reach high, that 'halos' among them. And that's what I treasure in life, among emotional beings like us, beauty often lies at a middle point within a spectrum of goods and bads. 

It's the imperfection of our emotions that makes us special, and that also means that we can only be at our best when we are with other people, creating a better world together.
