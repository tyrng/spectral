title: Annual Camp of SJAMSABS
description: A St. John Ambulance Event
---
Annual Camp event last year by St. John Ambulans Malaysia of SMK Sultan Abu Bakar(SABS), Kuantan, Pahang held in SMK Sultan Abu Bakar, Kuantan . The complete original photo album was posted in the above St. John’s page last year, so this is my personal ‘Visually Aesthetic Collection’ of the event photographs. It’s kind of a blend of event and artistic approach, and slightly altered film tones.

Mainly shot under natural lighting, the usage of light rays was unusually heavy in these photos. Only night shots were flash-fired. Most shot using a 24mm f1.8 on a Nikon D700, and few from a Nikon D300s with a 50mm f1.8. All edited using Adobe Photoshop CC.
