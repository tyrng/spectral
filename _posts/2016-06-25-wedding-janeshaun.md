Being my first time to photograph a wedding, it was the most tensed experience I had in photography. 

Nevertheless, I'm extremely grateful to be invited to document this wonderful wedding, for the couple had been very thoughtful and friendly to me, even though I had made some mistakes, as I'm still new in the industry.
