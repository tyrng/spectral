title: For What's Coming
description: and a letter to myself
---
Dear friend,

You might feel unusual, but allow me to write to you as if I'm writing a letter. This makes me feel closer to my readers; this is important, as I've always wanted to tell my readers a lot about myself.

I'm really happy you're here, as this is the very beginning of this blogging platform of mine. So, you might be wondering:
<br><br>

What's Coming?
=============
<br>
It's a bit early to say, but I've plans to achieve the following in this platform,\\
which is right here, I'll do:

* some <b>photography tutorials</b> about basic photography theories (technical), some more advanced techniques, and also about post-processing / editing
* some very <b>personal articles</b> like this one (below)
* and occasionally, my <b>thoughts and point-of-views</b> on mainly photography, or maybe some of my field of interest including coding, etc.
* etc, etc... It's still early, really.

The plans are still really, really rough. And I hope I can deliver them to you as soon as I can.
<br><br>

You Can Stop Right Here If You Don't Give A Fuck About My Life
=============
<br>
... which is fine, because I don't care about many people too. But if you're one of those who wants to know me personally, start by reading this perhaps: \\
<br><br>
it's nothing, just...

A Letter To Myself

Dear 18-year-old Tyrone,

I know about those nights you have insomnia, kept rolling on the bed, hasn't changed your clothes because you're too tired for everything. Especially when you're alone, you have thousands of thoughts, driving you crazy.

I also know about those fake smiles. Those lies you tell people that you're fine but you're not, just to make sure they don't worry, or to make sure you don't show your weakness in front of them.

And I know sometimes you really want to be the kind of people who can light up others but you just don't have the energy to do so.

And sometimes when you do help people, you ask yourself: Who's going to help me?

But my dear friend, you must know you're a strong one, way stronger than you think, that you must keep up with the positivity. And keep away from the negativity. People do not drain your energy because they intend to, but you let them. It's not their fault.

Dear Tyrone,

For every storm comes another dawn. You will struggle, and be strained.

But you will prevail.

You will fall, and most of them will not do a thing to help.

But you will gain strength.

And that strength would be the most valuable thing you will gain.

Be thankful,\\
Tyrone.

Thank you, friend. As you can see, I used to be pretty messed up. If you've been following my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/tyrone0ng), you'd know how messed up I can be.

Stay tuned, friend.

Tyrone.
